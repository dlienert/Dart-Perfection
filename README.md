## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow the steps below to set up and run this project locally.

### 1. Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git

Using the terminal (ideally in virtual studio code), navigate to your folder on your computer by using the "cd" command (stands for change directory).
This could look something like:
cd Users/macBookBen/ProgrammingFiles/Dart

Then create a virtual environment with:
python -m venv vevn
The -m stands for "make" venv -> virtual environment and the second venv is the name for the file which in our case is called "venv".

For creating a virtual environment in windows:
.\venv\Scripts\activate

To activate the virtual environment (MacOS/Linux):
source venv/bin/activate

Or activate on Windows:
.\venv\Scripts\activate

The final step is to install the dependencies for your python virtual environment:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Your done!

To run the code click on the run icon arrow in visual studio code or past following command in terminal:
python your_main_script.py
